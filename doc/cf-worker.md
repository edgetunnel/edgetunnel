Unlike most Cloudflare products, the Developer Platform can be used to host content. Content stored on the Developer Platform (whether in conjunction with a Cloudflare storage offering or not) that we determine in our sole judgment to be illegal, harmful, or in violation of Section 5 of the Cloudflare Developer Platforms Supplemental Terms may be blocked or removed, and use of the Developer Platform for storage of such illegal or harmful content may result in suspension or termination of Cloudflare Services. While we generally try to provide notice of such action, we reserve the right to take action without notice as appropriate. For these purposes, illegal or harmful content includes but is not limited to: (a) content containing, promoting, or facilitating child sexual abuse material or human trafficking; (b) content that infringes on another personâ€™s intellectual property rights or is otherwise unlawful; (c) content that discloses sensitive personal information, incites or exploits violence, or is intended to defraud the public; and (d) content that seeks to distribute malware, facilitate phishing, or otherwise constitutes technical abuse.
